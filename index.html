          <h2>The Willy Wonka disaster: How a failed event illustrates the future of AI-driven advertising</h2>
          <p>AI has rapidly developed in recent years and is becoming more prevalent in our daily lives. 
            Is this a good or bad thing? For scientific purposes, it could be the beginning of a new, life-changing discovery. 
            However, AI may be a driving force for eliminating human creativity and fabricating experiences, such as the Glasglow Willy Wonka disaster. 
            This bizarre story of a supposedly magical experience that turned out to be shocking, confusing, and disappointing went viral a few weeks ago, mostly as a source of amusement for uninvolved observers. 
            But could this situation have more serious implications? In this episode, we discuss the details of the event, unethical advertising practices, what this event says about the future of AI, and precautions that could prevent situations such as this from happening again.</p>
